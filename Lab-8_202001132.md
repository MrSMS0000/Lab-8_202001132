### 1) Create a new Eclipse project, and within the project create a package.

### 2) Created a class for a Boa:
```java
// represents a boa constrictor
public class Boa {
  private String name;
  private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet
  private String favoriteFood;
  public Boa (String name, int length, String favoriteFood){
    this.name = name;
    this.length = length;
    this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
  }
  // returns true if this boa constrictor is healthy
  public boolean isHealthy(){
    return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");
  }
  // returns true if the length of this boa constrictor is
  // less than the given cage length
  public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength){
    return this.length < cageLength;
  }
}
```

### 3) Follow the instructions in the JUnit tutorial in the section “Creating a JUnit Test Case in Eclipse”. You’ll be creating a test case for the class Boa. When you’re asked to select test method stubs, select both isHealthy() and fitsInCage(int).

In the first , I am testing the isHealthy method of the Boa class. 
I created two Boa objects with different favorite foods, and verify that isHealthy returns true for the first object and false for the second object.
In the second test case, I am testing the fitsInCage method of the Boa class. 
I created two Boa objects with different lengths, and test whether they fit in cages of different lengths. 
I expect the first boa to fit in a cage of length 5 but not 3, and the second boa to fit in a cage of length 12 but not 9.

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class BoaTest {

  @Test
  public void testIsHealthy() {
      Boa boa1 = new Boa("Sneaky", 6, "granola bars");
      assertTrue(boa1.isHealthy());

      Boa boa2 = new Boa("Slithery", 8, "pizza");
      assertFalse(boa2.isHealthy());
  }

  @Test
  public void testFitsInCage() {
      Boa boa1 = new Boa("Slinky", 4, "mice");
      assertTrue(boa1.fitsInCage(5));
      assertFalse(boa1.fitsInCage(3));

      Boa boa2 = new Boa("Curly", 10, "rabbits");
      assertTrue(boa2.fitsInCage(12));
      assertFalse(boa2.fitsInCage(9));
  }
}
```

### 4) Now it’s time to write some unit tests. Notice that the BoaTest class that JUnit created for you contains stubs for several methods. The first stub (for the method setUp()) is annotated with @Before. The @Before annotation denotes that the method setUp() will be run prior to the execution of each test method. setUp() is typically used to initialize data needed by each test. Modify the setUp() method so that it creates a couple of Boa objects, as follows:

I added private fields for jen and ken to the BoaTest class, and initialized them in the setUp method. 
I also updated the testIsHealthy and testFitsInCage methods to use these Boa objects for testing.
Note that the setUp method will be executed before each test method, 
so any changes made to the Boa objects during a test will not affect the objects used in other tests.

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

  public class BoaTest {

  private Boa jen;
  private Boa ken;

  @Before
  public void setUp() throws Exception {
      jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
      ken = new Boa("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
  }

  @Test
  public void testIsHealthy() {
      assertTrue(jen.isHealthy());
      assertTrue(ken.isHealthy());
  }

  @Test
  public void testFitsInCage() {
      assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(3));
      assertFalse(ken.fitsInCage(2));
  }
}
```

### 5) JUnit also provided stubs for two test methods, each annotated with @Test. Work on the testIsHealthy() method first. The purpose of this method is to check that the isHealthy() method in the Boa class behaves the way it’s supposed to. In the JUnit tutorial, read the section on “Writing Tests”. Modify the testIsHealthy() method so that it checks the results of activating the isHealthy() method on the two Boa objects you created in setup().

we added assertions to the testIsHealthy method to check that the isHealthy method returns true for both Boa objects. We also added assertions to the testFitsInCage method to check that the fitsInCage method returns the expected results for the Boa objects.

<h3>testisHealthy() Method</h3>

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class BoaTest {

  private Boa jen;
  private Boa ken;

  @Before
  public void setUp() throws Exception {
      jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
      ken = new Boa("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
  }

  @Test
  public void testIsHealthy() {
      assertTrue(jen.isHealthy());
      assertTrue(ken.isHealthy());
  }

  @Test
  public void testFitsInCage() {
      assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(3));
      assertFalse(ken.fitsInCage(2));
  }
}
```

In this example, we added assertions to the testFitsInCage method to check that the fitsInCage method returns the expected results for both jen and ken when the cage length is less than, equal to, and greater than the length of the boa.
<h3>testFitsInCage() Method</h3>

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class BoaTest {

  private Boa jen;
  private Boa ken;

  @Before
  public void setUp() throws Exception {
      jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
      ken = new Boa("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
  }

  @Test
  public void testIsHealthy() {
      assertTrue(jen.isHealthy());
      assertTrue(ken.isHealthy());
  }

  @Test
  public void testFitsInCage() {
      assertFalse(jen.fitsInCage(1)); // cage length less than boa length
      assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(2)); // cage length equal to boa length
      assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(3)); // cage length greater than boa length

      assertFalse(ken.fitsInCage(2)); // cage length less than boa length
      assertTrue(ken.fitsInCage(3)); // cage length equal to boa length
      assertTrue(ken.fitsInCage(4)); // cage length greater than boa length
  }
}
```
Note that the testFitsInCage method is now more robust, as it checks the behavior of the fitsInCage method for different input values.

### 6) Running test cases
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84451780/233321905-16c455c8-5137-4f74-b432-d1d7d3aee9c6.png)



### 7) Add a new method to the Boa class, with this purpose and signature:
```java
// produces the length of the Boa in inches
public int lengthInInches(){
// you need to write the body of this method
}
```
Add a new test case to the BoaTest class that tests the lengthInInches() method. Make
sure you annotate the new test method with @Test. Run your tests.

<h3>The updated code of Boaclass with new lengthInInches()</h3>

```java
public class Boa {

  private String name;

  private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet

  private String favoriteFood;

  public Boa(String name, int length, String favoriteFood) {
      this.name = name;
      this.length = length;
      this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
  }

  // returns true if this boa constrictor is healthy
  public boolean isHealthy() {
      return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");
  }

  // returns true if the length of this boa constrictor is
  // less than the given cage length
  public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength) {
      return this.length < cageLength;
  }

  // produces the length of the Boa in inches
  public int lengthInInches() {
      return this.length * 12;
  }

}
```

Here is the updated code for the BoaTest class with the new testLengthInInches() method:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.Before;

import org.junit.Test;

public class BoaTest {
      private Boa jen;
      private Boa ken;

  @Before
  public void setUp() throws Exception {
      jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
      ken = new Boa("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
  }

  @Test
  public void testIsHealthy() {
      assertFalse(jen.isHealthy());
      assertTrue(ken.isHealthy());
  }

  @Test
  public void testFitsInCage() {
      assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(24));
      assertFalse(jen.fitsInCage(16));
      assertTrue(ken.fitsInCage(36));
      assertTrue(ken.fitsInCage(24));
      assertFalse(ken.fitsInCage(18));
  }

  @Test
  public void testLengthInInches() {
      assertEquals(24, jen.lengthInInches());
      assertEquals(36, ken.lengthInInches());
  }
}
  ```
 
  This new test case checks that the lengthInInches() method returns the expected value when called on each of the Boa objects created in the setUp() method. It uses the assertEquals() method to compare the expected value to the actual value returned by the lengthInInches() method. The @Test annotation indicates that this is a test method that should be run by JUnit.
